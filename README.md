Why? This project explores how to connect APIs

How to use? Clone this repository to your local system and open the index.html file. Then move your mouse around the screen to see the effect. 

What's coming? Plans to build out this environment to have the current image of Mona Lisa being one of several gallery images in a museum type environment. I want to explore designing interactive rooms to understand more about user/code interactibility as well as how to design using perspective.
